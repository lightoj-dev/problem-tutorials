Actually, I have read too many codes of this problem on the net. And, most of them are accepted. But, No one passes the test case given by me. They all take 6 to 7 seconds at least. Depending on the problem description, I couldn't find any bug in my test case. Can you review my case? The case has 10000 test cases and in every case, the value of n is 999966000289. An accepted code is given also. Thanks.
