# LightOJ 1057 - Farthest Nodes in a Tree (II)
---
### What the problem wants:<br> 
For each node, you have to find another node in the `undirected` and `weighted` graph so that their intermediate distance is maximum and you have to print that distance for all nodes. <br>

### How to solve: <br>
Consider this sample:
```
9
3 5 18
3 1 1
1 0 30
1 8 8
1 6 56
0 4 31
4 7 58
0 2 58

```
This sample can be represented in a graph like below:
