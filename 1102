# LOJ 1102 - Problem Makes Problem

In this problem, you will be given `T` testcases. The first line of each test case contains two integers `n` and `k`. We have to find the number of ways we can add `k` number of  variables so that the `sum` is equivalent to `n`

To be more precise, suppose `n=4` and k=`3` so have to  find the number of ways `x1+x2+x3==4`



### Approach:
In order to solve this problem there are few prerequisite that need to be fulfilled which are you need to have a basic understanding of combinatorics and inverse modulo which will be provided in the later portion.
So having a clear concept of the topics above,we can solve this problem.Now let's think using the test case `n=4,k=3` it means let's imagine there are 4 stars * * * * and now we got to segment these 4 stars into 3 regions so that summation of stars in each segments is equivalent to 4
To be more clear,notice  in the diagram `* | * * | * ` where we could  seperate the 4 stars into 3 segments using two bars.Now in the `first segment we have `x1=1`,`x2=2` and `x3=1`
which is equivalent to 4 now since our particular segment can have zero as well  so `| * * | * *` can be true as well where `x1=0`,`x2=2` and `x3=2` so lets imagine we are given an array where there are n+k-1 number of spaces which is 4(n)+2(k-1)
so now we have to find the number of ways we can `arrange` these two(k-1) bars within the `n+k-1` sized array so that we have `k` segments whose sum is equivalent to n
Now if you know `combination/combinatorics` you can easily tell the answer to this problem.If you don't you can always check the `code`given
This concept also coinsides with the famous theorem `Stars and Bars Method`,Link to have a deep understanding will be given at a later part

`Notes:` We have to find the factorials upto 2*10^6 even though the constraint of this problem for both n and k is 1*10^6 only for the purpose of calculation

###C++ Implementation:
```
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
#define ll long long
#define int ll
#define MOD 1000000007
int modPow(int b, int p)
{
    int r = 1;
    while(p)
    {
        if(p&1)
            r = (r*b)%MOD;
        b = (b*b)%MOD;
        p >>= 1;
    }
    return r;
}
int fact[2000009+2];
void factorial()
{
    fact[0]=1;
    for(int i=1; i<2000002; i++)
    {
        fact[i]=(fact[i-1]%MOD*i)%MOD;
    }
}
main()
{
    int t;
    factorial();
    cin>>t;
    for(int i=1; i<=t; i++)
    {
        int n,k;
        cin>>n>>k;
        int ans=fact[n+k-1]; //bars can be like this | * * | * * which means 0 2 2 ==4 so the ways we can arrange  these 2 bars to make 3 segments so that their summation is n is the formula
        int r=(fact[n]*fact[k-1])%MOD; //fact[n+k-1-(k-1)]==fact[n]                           n+k-1 c r-1 means there are  6 characters and how many ways we can put the 2 bars among these 6 characters
        ans=(ans*modPow(r,MOD-2));
        cout<<"Case "<<i<<": "<<ans%MOD<<endl;
    }
}
```
