**What the problem wants :** The problem is very straightforward implementation problem that uses two stacks. Just implement the four given queries 'Forward' ,'BACKWARD' , 'VISIT' & 'QUIT' .

**General Approach to the solution :** We can start by creating two stacks.Lets consider them as the _FORWARD_ stack and _BACK_ stack , for tracking the URLs. As we simply have to simulate the the process according to the queries, we will use these two stacks and implement specific actions for each query . The 'FORWARD' and 'BACKWARD' queries are essentially almost the same, we just have to move the top element to the other stack. However ,the 'VISIT' query is a bit different. We will have to take a new url as input and empty the FORWARD stack ,then push the inputted url to the forward stack . 
The entire process stops when we get the 'QUIT' query. 

Also at the start we have to push the "http://www.lightoj.com/" url to the FORWARD stack.

**Implementation for each query :**
 
 - **FORWARD :** If the size of the _FORWARD_ stack is less than 2 print `Ignored` . Else , Push the top element of the _FORWARD_ stack to the _BACK_ stack and print the new top element of the _FORWARD_ stack.

 - **BACK :** If the size of the BACK stack is less than 2 print `Ignored`. Else , Push the top element of the _BACK_ stack to the _FORWARD_ stack and print the new top element of the _FORWARD_ stack .

 - **VISIT :** First take a new input as a string (for the given url). If the FORWARD stack is empty print `Ignored` . Else , push top element of the _FORWARD_ stack to the _BACK_ stack and empty the total _FORWARD_ stack. Then push the new inputted string to the empty _FORWARD_ stack and print the top element of the _FORWARD_ stack (the url we took as input).

 - **QUIT :** Stop taking taking inputs and end the program.  

**Note :** Even though we will initialize both stacks as empty stacks for each test case , remember to push the string "http://www.lightoj.com/" to the FORWARD stack at the beginning .

### Visual representation:

![Illustration of different query](figure.svg)

**Top Part :** As we can see in the above illustration , the first part shows the visual representation of "FORWARD" and "BACK" query . On "FORWARD" query the top element of _FORWARD stack_ is moved to the _BACK stack_ . OR the state changes as `state-1 => state-2`

For the "BACK" query the exact opposite happens as the state changes as `state-2 => state-1`

**Bottom Part :** The second part of the illustration visualizes what happens during the "VISIT" query . At step one we move the top element of the _FORWARD stack_ to _BACK stack_ . Then at step-2 we empty the _Forward stack_ that's why "www.google.com" is gone. Then we take our input and push it in the _FORWARD stack_. Incase of the illustration the input was "www.input.com" .
