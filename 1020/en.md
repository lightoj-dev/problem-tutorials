# LOJ 1020 - A Childhood Game

## Summary

In this problem, you have to find the winner of the game if both Alice and Bob play optimally.

The game is playing by alternating turns. In each turn a player can take exactly `1` or `2` marbles.

Both of them know the number of marbles initially. Now the game can be started by any one. But the winning condition depends on the player who starts it. If `Alice` starts first, then the player who takes the `last marble` `looses` the game. If `Bob` starts first, then the player who takes the `last marble` `wins` the game.

## Hint

Consider both of them different case. Start from 1 marbel and gradually increase the marbel. Try to find a pattern.

# Solution
## Approach

Lets consider '1' as first move and '2' as 2nd move. we will try to win first move(1) if possible.

If Alice start first,<br>

If `N = 1` 2 wins. who takes last loses<br>
If `N = 2` 1 wins. Alice takes 1 marbel and bob have to take last one.<br>
If `N = 3` 1 wins. Alice takes 2 marbel and bob have to take last one.<br>
If `N = 4` 2 wins. why ? if he takes 1 marbel opposite N(4-1) = 2 and if he takes 2 marbel opposite N(4-2) =2, So it is garanted 2 wins.
continue this process you will find pattern of 2 1 1 2 1 1 ... 

similar;y If Bob start first, you will find pattern of 1 1 2 1 1 2 ...

- Time Complexity: `O(1)` per test case.
- Memory Complexity: `O(1)` per test case.

## Code
### C++

```cpp

#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std ;

void _main_main()
{
    int n ;
    string s ;
    cin >> n >> s ;
    if(s == "Alice"){
        if (n%3 == 1) cout << "Bob\n" ;
        else cout << "Alice\n" ;
    }
    else {
        if (n%3 != 0) cout << "Bob\n" ;
        else cout << "Alice\n" ;
    }
}

int main ()
{
    int testCase = 1 ; cin >> testCase ;
    for (int i = 0; i < testCase; i++){
        cout << "Case " << i+1 << ": " ;
        _main_main() ;
    }
}




```

Happy Coding!
