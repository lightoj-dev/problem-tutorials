# LightOj 1096 - nth Term

## **Hint** 
you need to find the n-th term of a recurrence relation. that immediately implies you might be able to solve it using matrix exponentiation. if you don't know what matrix exponentiation is, visit [this link](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/80195).

## **Solution summary**

We can see that the base cases of the recurrence relation are f(0) f(1) and f(2). that implies we can use a 3x1 matrix to store the three base cases and derive values of next terms from these values. We can see that we also need to always add a constant *c* to every new term independent of the previous values. So we add **1** to the end of our base case matrix so that it can always add a constant to every new term. So now we have to find a matrix such that it can produce [f(1), f(2), f(3), 1]<sup>T</sup> from [f(0), f(1), f(2), 1]<sup>T</sup>.

lets call this 3x1 matrix the answer matrix.

if we observe closely in our new answer matrix. In every new iteration only the value of 3rd row is new and all the other 3 values can be copied exactly from the answer matrix of previous iteration. and the new 3rd row can be obtained by multiplying first row by **b**, 3rd row by **a** and 4th row by **c**. 

so the desired matrix is:

    { 0, 1, 0, 0 }
    { 0, 0, 1, 0 }
    { b, 0, a, c }
    { 0, 0, 0, 1 }

Now we just have to exponentiate this n times to find the n-th term of the recurrence relation.

## **Code:** 

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
#define ll long long int


const ll mod = 10007;
typedef vector<vector<ll> > matrix ; 

class Matrix {
	public:
		matrix mat;
		ll r, c;
		Matrix(ll r, ll c) {
			this->r = r;
			this->c = c;
			mat.resize(r, vector<ll>(c) );			
		}

		vector<ll> operator [] (ll i) const { return mat[i]; }
		vector<ll>& operator [] (ll i) { return mat[i]; }

		Matrix operator *( Matrix const &B ) {
			Matrix res(r,B.c);
			// just trust that it works
			for(ll i=0; i<r; i++) 
				for(ll j=0; j<c; j++) 
					for(ll k=0; k<B.c; k++) {
						res.mat[i][k] = ( res.mat[i][k] + mat[i][j] * B.mat[j][k] ) % mod;
					}
			return res;
		}

		void initialize_unit() {
			for(int i=0; i<r; i++) {
				mat[i][i] = 1;
			} 
		}

};



Matrix exp( Matrix A, ll e ) {
	Matrix res(A.r,A.c);
	res.initialize_unit();
	while(e) {
		if( e % 2 ) 
			res = A * res;
		e /= 2;
		A = A * A ;
	}
	return res;
}


int main(){
	int tc, a, b, c, i, ix, t, n, m, k, p, q, gg, x, y, z;
	cin >> t;
	for(tc=1; tc<=t; tc++) {
		cin >> n >> a >> b >> c;
		Matrix A(4,4);
		Matrix B(4,1);
		A.mat = {
			{ 0, 1, 0, 0 },
			{ 0, 0, 1, 0 },
			{ b, 0, a, c },
			{ 0, 0, 0, 1 }
		};
		B.mat = {
			{0},
			{0},
			{0},
			{1}
		};
		A = exp(A,n);
		B = A * B;
	    cout << "Case " << tc << ": " << B.mat[0][0] << "\n";
	}
}
