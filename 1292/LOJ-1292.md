### Simplified Version
You have points on a flat surface (xy plane). You want to draw a line in a way that the most points possible lie on that line. What's the highest number of points that can be on one line?

## Observation
1. If two lines have the same slope, they are parallel.

2. If a point lies on two parallel lines, those lines are actually the same line.

First, for each of the n points, pick one point and determine the slope between that point and all the other points.

The most common slope value gives us the most points on a line drawn from a certain point.

By repeating this process for every point, the highest count of shared slopes becomes the solution.

### How to Calculate Slope:

If two points are (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) then slope of those two point is,

Let, a = x2 - x1, b = y2 - y1 , g = gcd(a, b).

slope = (a/gcd)/(b/gcd)
