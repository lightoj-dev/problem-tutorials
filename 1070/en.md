# LOJ 1070 - Alebraic Problem

## Summary
Given three non-negative integers, a+b = **p**, ab = **q** and **n** we have to find the value of $a^n$+$b^n$. a and b not necessarily have to be integers.

## Solution


## Complexity
- Time Complexity: O(T * $k^3$ log(n)). Here, k = 2
- Memory Complexity: O(1).
