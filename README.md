# LightOJ Volume Problem Tutorials
This repository contains tutorials for LightOJ volume problems.

### Contribution Guideline
This whole project is based on voluntary contribution. You are more than welcome to contribute. If you think you can write a tutorial for a problem, please create
an issue first like this: https://github.com/lightoj-dev/problem-tutorials/issues/2 and then assign yourself. This will make sure no other person is working on the same problem's tutorial. Then add your tutorial by a pull request like this: https://github.com/lightoj-dev/problem-tutorials/pull/1

We are planning to have tutorials both in Bangla and English language. But you don't need to work on both, write the English one first, then maybe you or other contributor can translate it to Bangla.

Each problem will have its own folder with the name of its problem id, such as 1000, 1214. Each folder will contain tutorial as `en.md` file for English and `bn.md` for Bangla language.

Each tutorial should explain what is the problem is asking (maybe in simpler way than the problem description), what algorithm is required to solve the problem, why we need to use that algorithm, what other options out there to solve this problem. You don't need to give idea about all the different algorithms, you can just explain one way of solving the problem. Feel free to add any image if you think appropriate. Also include any other 3rd party article, book link so that other problem solver can learn from there. If you already shared the tutorial on other website (maybe your personal blog site), you can mention those link on the tutorial. And last but not the least, add your code on the tutorial. Please properly indent your code, also add comments on your code to make code more readable to problem solvers.

Looking forward to have your contribution.
