# 1062 - Crossed Ladders : 

A ladder with length **X** rested from the base and lean with the right building. Another ladder with length **Y** rested from another right side's base and lean with the left side's base. These two ladders are crossed at a point **N**. The length between **M** and **N** is **h**. We have to find the width **d** of the road. 

In this problem, you are given **T** testcases to execute. For each test case you will be given **X**, **Y** and **h**. You have to find the value of **d** for every single test cases.

In the crossed ladder problem two ladder ```AC``` and ```BD``` crossed each other at point ```N```. The length of ```AC``` and ```BD``` is ```X``` and ```Y``` respectively. You are also given the value of length ```h```. Let's denote ```AB = h1``` , ```CD = h2```, ```AD = d```  . From these values, we can find out the value of ```d```. Using basic observation it is pretty clear that the value of ```d``` will always be less than the values of ```X``` and ```Y```. You can apply a bisection over this ```d``` length to get a nearly correct result. 

From the theory of crossed ladder problem we can say that ,

See the images below for further clarifications about the equation.

Hence We have the proof about the equation.

Now, we can start the bisection by denoting the parameters ```low = d = 0``` and ```high = d = minimum(X, Y)```. Every time we have to find the ```mid``` value between ```low``` and ```high```. A nice property that lies in the crossed ladder problem is when the width ```d``` increases the height ```h``` decreases and vice versa. That means from several ```mid``` values of width we just have found such a value that will fairly equal to ```h```.

Let the ```mid = K``` ( in general d ) and you have the value of ```X```. From pythagorean theorem, we know,

From this equation, We can show that -

So, now you have the value of ```h1``` and ```h2``` . You can easily find ,

For a value of ```mid```, we will found the approximate value of real ```h```. Now for every calculated ```h```, you easily can compare with the original ```h```.
